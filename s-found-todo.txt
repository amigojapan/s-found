	-(done: decided on paged)modules
		amigojapan: darkf: I think the other hard part will be braking up the projects into “modules” or “Pages”    
		to be able to break up a project into smalled pices, becuase blockly does not have such a functionality….
		I want my users to be able to develop in smaller pages, cause making a huge block program in only one workspace
		would be hell

	-(done)implement hide show sprite blocks
	-(done)load and save xml for blocks in text mode
	-(done2016-2-4)implement it in a mock download upload style
		Meowmers: amigojapan_: Wait, each element of that array is of type File (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
		[3:48pm] Meowmers: amigojapan_: After you get your file object, you use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader to read the content of that file.
		[3:48pm] Meowmers: amigojapan_: Then after you use the file reader constructor to create a file reader, you use .readAsText() on that.
		[3:49pm] Meowmers: amigojapan_: That is going to give you a string with the contents of the file.
	-(fixed)bug, there seems to be more events of hte same kind fired every time eval is clicked
	-(changed to adjust to teh fps)can i reduce the eventloop timer to 0 ms, and if so will it still run? what is the optimal event polling time setting?
	-(I think this is done, check later)stop timmers when script is stopped
	-I think I will make a free version that needs to be connected online, and a pay version for offline if I see many people download it
	
	-(done)make some way of implenting timers, maybe like in scratch (this should be easy for me), or maybe, if possible(not sure if I can do it cause it is functional) make it in the way Javascript does times with set_interval
	-(done)make frogger in s-found
	-(done)add a comment to the code that mentions what "page" the code is on
	-(done)make the programming div 95% width so that the vertical scrollbar is usable on mac
	-(done)make a way  to detect a colission between two clones of a sprite
		greg suggested making a second kind of block which would be put under the normal [for each clone of sprite] but
		one that works for the clones of the target and can be nested inside the other block, use different variable names than the other block too
		what should I call such a block? [nested loop on target sprite]? man , this is getting hard for noobs to understand
	-modify timer block to accept an ID thru a variable too (to make bomberman enemy explode in a certain time)
	-add block to clear timer(put intide timer function itself(is this possible?) (should also accept a variable as input)
		amigojapan wonders if it is possible to set a clearTimeour() inside a setTimeout()’s callback function  /me googles
		[5:43pm] amigojapan: yes, seems it is possible to fo it :)
	-add A and B button to put bomb down
		try to make a general function so it is easy to add any button
		https://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/key
		Phaser.Keyboard.A
	-(partially done, need to interage with the main project) make dialog box for managing sprites and frames
		-fix problem of adding a frame to second object adds the frame to first object
	-make aliases for frame names
	-add a block to switch to an aliased frame
	-for some other game modify collision block or make other block od "clone colide with clone" how to know which clone colised 
		with which clone? maybe have a way to return both IDs as strings? does not seem ideal.
	-(partially done, elminated highlights from code displayed to user)fix highlight problem appearing in code
	-make terminal window
	-bomberman (use for each clone of bombs colide with bomberman, use foreach baddy collide with bomberman)
		how will I deal with baddy colides with bomb,try nested forwach, but probably wont work cause of shared object counter?
		if it does not work make the counter a member of each game_object
	-vewis (make example that follows a character)
		I think I will just move everything together with the backround except the main character... naybe make
		a (for everything except currect sprite block) to do this... use that block then move everything in the direction pointed
		also need to specify if we want the background scaled of now, this should probably show anothed dialogbox with a checkmark
		coudl also put some values and add a "scale all sprites by this" also with a checkmark.
	-(partly done, need to apply all buttons and then integrate with main project)make screen controls(how can I make them repeat while they are pressed like keys do? (maybe a timer for each button huh...))
		maybe make a function that encapsuled the definition of a key to make it eaasy to add any new keys
		maybe make a timer which calls the function of a key repeatedly to simulate key pressing until ti is released
	-add blocks for sprite width and sprite height(should I bother to make it of the current frame? maybe later)
	-prevent highlighting from causing problems when there is only another view(cause only highllights for this page to appear)
	-make an export to standalone feature
	-make particle system
	-make a block that returns the current angle, call it direction like in scratch?
	-clear all the sprites when new project is loaded, also make a new project loadable even if user does not refresh window
	-clear workspace when deleted page

	priorities: make possible collision detection between 2 sprite cclones(done), fix problem with sprite manager
